I am a Baggett Fellow in the Linguistics Department at the University of Maryland College Park. I am advised by Dr. Masha Polinsky and Dr. Aron Hirsch. My research centers around Syntax with a primary empirical focus on Kaqchikel, a K’ichean Mayan language spoken in Guatemala. I also have other projects on Exceptive constructions in Thai (Kra–Dai) and wh- in Turkish (Turkic). 


(Neg)

My primary research projectcenters around syntax, specifically focus structure, cleft structures, and relative clauses in Kaqchikel. I am currently looking at the syntax of negation in Kaqchikel and using it as a window to understand other parts of the syntax: namely focus movement and X0 movement, and copular syntax. Please read more about this project here.

(Q) 

I have a current project joint with Aron Hirsh, that looks at the behavior of Q (cable) in the A domain as opposed to the A-bar domain. We look at selection, Case, and A-movement to understand at what point the Q element is integrated into a structure in the derivation. We question whether Q can originate in an A position at all. Please read more about this project here. 

(Superiority) 

I have a project joint with Utku Turk, that looks at examples of surprising superiority effects with Turkish multiple wh. Turkish has free discourse configurationality and allows overt focus movement and scrambling. Thus we do not always see superiority effects (citation) with multiple wh. However, we have observed a surprising ungrammaticality pattern in which certain wh movements are banned when the wh element is an adjunct and there is another adjunct within the phrase. 


(Exceptives) 

As a part of the Variation in Exceptive Structures Grant (Grant N.O.) led by Masha Polisnksky and Eric Potsdam, I am investigating the nature of exceptive constructions in Thai. Please Navigate to this webpage to learn more about the grant projec, or read more about my contribution here. 

Copular Syntax in Kaqchikel

Through my investigation of Negation in Kaqchikel, I discovered interesting data that suggest that a particle ja which has been traditionally analyzed and referred to in the literature as a focus particle is actually a copula that surfaces in certain contexts.
