I am a Baggett Fellow in the Linguistics Department at the [University of Maryland, College Park]. I am advised by Dr. [Masha Polinsky] and Dr. [Aron Hirsch]. My research centers around Syntax with a primary empirical focus on Kaqchikel, a K’ichean Mayan language spoken in Guatemala. I also have other projects on Exceptive constructions in Thai (Kra–Dai), QP syntax, and Wh- in Turkish (Turkic). 

I did my B.A. in Linguistics at The University of California, Santa Cruz. My undergraduate advisors were [Matt Wagers][matt] and [Jess H.K. Law][law].
