## Negation in Kaqchikel

My primary research project centers around the syntax of focus structure, cleft structures, and relative clauses in Kaqchikel. I am currently looking at the syntax of negation in this language and using it as a window to understand other parts of the syntax, namely focus movement, head movement, and copular syntax. 

## Q in the A Domain 

I have a current project joint with [Aron Hirsh], that looks at the behavior of Q in the A domain as opposed to the A-bar domain. We look at selection, Case, and A-movement to understand at what point in the derivation the Q element is integrated into the structure. We question whether Q can originate in an A-position at all. 

## Superiority Effects in Turkish Multiple *wh*

I have a project joint with [Utku Turk], that looks at examples of surprising superiority effects with Turkish multiple *wh*. Turkish has free discourse configurationality and allows overt focus movement and scrambling. Thus we do not always see superiority effects with multiple *wh* constructions. However, we have observed a surprising ungrammaticality pattern in which certain *wh* movements are banned when the *wh* element is an adjunct and there is another adjunct within the phrase. 

## Exceptives

As a part of the research project [Variation in Exceptive Structures] funded by the National Science Foundation (Grants BCS-2116343 and BCS-2116344), led by [Masha Polisnksky] and [Eric Potsdam], I am investigating the nature of exceptive constructions in Thai. Please Navigate to this [webpage] to learn more about the grant project.

## Copular Syntax in Kaqchikel

Through my investigation of Negation in Kaqchikel, I discovered interesting data that suggest that a particle *ja* which has been traditionally analyzed and referred to in the literature as a focus particle is actually a copula that surfaces in certain contexts such as pseudo-clefts or specification.
